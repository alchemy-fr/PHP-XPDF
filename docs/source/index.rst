PHP XPDF documentation
======================

Introduction
------------

PHP-XPDF is an object oriented library to handle
`XPDF <http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/>`_, an open source project self-described
as "a viewer for Portable Document Format files. The Xpdf project also includes
a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other utilities."

For the moment, there's only one handler for PDF2Text.

This library depends on
`Symfony Process Component <https://github.com/symfony/process>`_ and
`Monolog <https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog>`_.

Installation
------------

PHP-XPDF relies on `composer <http://getcomposer.org/>`_. If you do not yet
use composer for your project, you can start with this ``composer.json`` at the
root of your project:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "php-xpdf/php-xpdf": "master"
        }
    }

Install composer :

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install composer
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    # Upgrade your install
    php composer.phar install

You now just have to autoload the library to use it :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

This is a very short intro to composer. If you ever experience an issue or want
to know more about composer, you will find help on its dedicated website
`http://getcomposer.org/ <http://getcomposer.org/>`_.

PDF2Text
--------

Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Monolog\Logger;
    use Monolog\Handler\NullHandler;
    use XPDF\PdfToText;

    // Create a logger
    $logger = new Logger('MyLogger');
    $logger->pushHandler(new NullHandler());

    // You have to pass a Monolog logger
    // This logger provides some usefull infos about what's happening
    $pdfToText = PdfToText::load($logger);

    // open PDF
    $pdfToText->open('PDF-book.pdf');

    // PDF text is now in the $text variable
    $text = $pdfToText->getText();
    $pdfToText->close();

Using Custom Binary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PDF2Text is automatically detected if its path install is in the PATH.
if you want to use your own PdfTotext binary, use as follow :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $pdfToText = new PdfToText('/path/to/your/binary', $logger);

or, on Windows platform :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $pdfToText = new PdfToText('C:\XPDF\PDF2Text.exe', $logger);

Charset encoding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, output text is UTF-8 encoded. But if you want a custom output , use
the ``setOutputEncoding`` method

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $pdfToText->setOutputEncoding('ISO-8859-5');

.. note:: The charset value should be an iconv compatible value.

Extract page range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can restrict the text extraction on page range. For example to extract pages
3 to 6 ;

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $pdfToText->getText(3, 6);

Silex Service Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

XPDF is bundled with a `Silex <http://silex.sensiolabs.org>`_ Service Provider.
Use it is very simple :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Silex\Application;
    use XPDF\XPDFServiceProvider;

    $app = new Application();
    $app->register(new XPDFServiceProvider());

    // You have access to PDF2Text
    $app['xpdf.pdf2text']->open(...);


You can, of course, customize it :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Silex\Application;
    use XPDF\XPDFServiceProvider;

    $app = new Application();
    $app->register(new XPDFServiceProvider(), array(
        'xpdf.pdf2text.binary' => '/your/custom/binary',
        'xpdf.logger'          => $my_logger,
    ));

    // You have access to PDF2Text
    $app['xpdf.pdf2text']->open(...);


Handling Exceptions
-------------------

XPDF throws 4 different types of exception :

- ``\XPDF\Exception\BinaryNotFoundException`` is thrown when no acceptable
  pdf2text binary is found.
- ``\XPDF\Exception\InvalidFileArgumentException`` is thrown when an invalid
  file is supplied for text extraction
- ``\XPDF\Exception\LogicException`` which extends SPL LogicException
- ``\XPDF\Exception\RuntimeException`` which extends SPL RuntimeException

All these Exception implements ``\XPDF\Exception\Exception`` so you can catch
any of these exceptions by catching this exception interface.
